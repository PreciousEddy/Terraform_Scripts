# Service Mesh Setup with AWS App Mesh in EKS

This repository provides Terraform scripts to set up a service mesh using AWS App Mesh in an EKS cluster.

## Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Terraform installed

## Steps to Set Up the Service Mesh

### Step 1: Set up the EKS cluster
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Terraform code.
2. Execute the following commands:

```terraform init```

```terraform plan```

```terraform apply```


### Step 2: Install and configure the AWS App Mesh Controller for Kubernetes
1. Deploy the AWS App Mesh Controller for Kubernetes using Helm by following the instructions in the official documentation.

### Step 3: Configure and deploy microservices with App Mesh integration
1. Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the App Mesh service.
2. Create a new App Mesh mesh by providing a name and selecting the EKS cluster you created.
3. Define virtual services, routes, and other App Mesh resources using the App Mesh console.
4. Associate your microservices with the appropriate virtual services defined in App Mesh.

### Step 4: Enable monitoring and control
1. Set up AWS CloudWatch Container Insights for monitoring your microservices.
2. Configure AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing to gain insights into service-to-service communication.

### Step 5: Deploy the microservices and service mesh
1. Deploy your microservices using kubectl or other preferred deployment methods.
2. Verify that the microservices are running and communicating successfully.

### Step 6: Test and validate
1. Perform thorough testing to validate the communication between microservices and the behavior of the service mesh features.
2. Monitor logs, metrics, and traces in AWS CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray to gain insights into the communication patterns and troubleshoot any issues.

## Further Customization and Configuration
- Modify the Terraform code to suit your specific requirements, including adding more microservices, adjusting routing rules, configuring access control, etc.
- Consult the official AWS documentation for more information on advanced configuration options and features of AWS App Mesh.
